# HybridCNN Library

`HybridCNN` is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with residual blocks and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks. This library provides the `HybridCNN` model, which can be easily integrated into PyTorch-based deep learning workflows.

## Features

- Residual blocks (inspired by ResNet)
- Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks for attention
- Hybrid architecture suitable for image classification tasks

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the package locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ran0707/hybrid_cnn.git
cd hybrid_cnn
pip install .
